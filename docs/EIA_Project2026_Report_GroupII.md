# Challenges Overcome

### Git & GitHub

There was a point in the pull request & merge review process where multiple uploads from different team members overlapped, causing conflicts. This forced us to learn about stashing and rebasing to the newly updated master branch before recommitting. The following process was ironed out to ensure a smooth integration:

1. Stash local (uncommitted) changes
   ```bash
      git stash
   ```
2. Pull latest changes from master branch
   ```bash
      git checkout master
      git pull main master
   ```
3. Rebase local changes onto master branch so it starts after the new merged code
   ```bash
      git checkout <fork-feature>/<fork-branch>
      git rebase master
   ```
4. Resolve any conflicts & re-apply stashed changes
   ```bash
      git stash pop
   ```
5. Commit and push (using ```--force``` parameter due to rebase)
   ```bash
      git push <fork-remote> <fork-branch> --force
   ```
